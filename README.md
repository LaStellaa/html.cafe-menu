## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project i learned to use CSS variables , which help greatly when you have multiple elements with the same color throughtout the code. 



### Continued development

Moving forward i would like to keep focusing on Flex and Grid until i feel truly confident with it.
